# Tamr AWS Elasticsearch Terraform Module
This terraform module creates an Elasticsearch (ES) domain on AWS.

**Prerequisite**

This module requires an [IAM service linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/slr-es.html) for ES on the AWS account.

To create an ES service role in terraform:
```
resource "aws_iam_service_linked_role" "es-service-role" {
  aws_service_name = "es.amazonaws.com"
}
```

There can be only one service linked role for per AWS account.

You may run into an error like this when trying to remove the ES service linked role if there is still an Elasticsearch domain in the account:
```
Error: Error waiting for role (arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/aws-service-role/es.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForAmazonElasticsearchService) to be deleted: unexpected state 'FAILED', wanted target 'SUCCEEDED'.
```

You will need to ensure all the domains are completely removed before attempting to remove the ES linked service role. If it appears like all the domains have already been removed, you can try again.

This repo is based on:
* [terraform standard module structure](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html#standard-module-structure)
* [templated terraform module](https://github.com/tmknom/template-terraform-module)

# Development
## Generating Docs
Run `make gen` to generate the section of docs around terraform inputs, outputs and requirements.

## Checkstyles
Run `make lint`, this will run terraform fmt, in addition to a few other checks to detect whitespace issues.
NOTE: this requires having docker working on the machine running the test

## Releasing new versions
* Update version contained in `VERSION`
* Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
* Create a tag in github for the commit associated with the version
